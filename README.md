# Barbarian!

A ~~Rogue~~Barbarian-like - created as an attempt to follow the famous [Python3 Roguelike tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/) using C++ and SDL2.
The master branch has the current ('stable') version of the game, which is currently on Part 3 of the tutorial.

I'll be updating [the blog](zwilder.github.io) with my thoughts and rambles about this project.

[Week 1: Parts 0-2](https://zwilder.github.io/posts/2018-06-20-the-roguelike-tutorial-week1/)

**Stay tuned for next week, when I talk about BSP dungeons, SDL, and other nonsense!**
